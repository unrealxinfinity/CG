## TP 4 Notes

- In the initial experiences, had a better understanding of texture mapping by experimenting with different mapping coordinates for the pixels in the textels;
- In part 1, we initialized a texture using a picture of a tangram and mapped each of the vertices with a texture cordinate corresponding the geometrical shape formed by the vertices in order to map the texture to MyTangram;
- In part 2, we did essentially the same as the first exercise, but we mapped a cube with different textures for each of the faces and we played around with the filtering by uncommenting a line of code related to the scene.
